Hello everyone ! 

I am very proud to release this demo version of level 1 of Miracle Boy in Dragon Land (aka MBiDL) to the public.

MBiDL is a Japanese-style RPG game and a sequel to Wonder Boy. it's made with love in 68000 assembler.

You can play the game with an Atari ST emulator like Steem SSE, Hatari or SainT.

It is compatible with all Atari ST families (ST, STFm, STE, TT, Falcon) with at least 1 MB of memory.
