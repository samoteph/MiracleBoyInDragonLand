Hello everyone ! 

I am very proud to release this demo version of level 1 of Miracle Boy in Dragon Land to the public.

You can play the game with an Atari ST emulator like Steem SSE, Hatari or SainT.

It is compatible with all Atari ST families (ST, STFm, STE, TT, Falcon) with at least 1 MB of memory.

Enjoy !
